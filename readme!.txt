okay i decide to release the source of tocan's calradia - but respect my rules!
if you use this source for your public mod credit me and write me an email (toca_s86@hotmail.com) with the mod name and website/forum thread - the same if you use parts of the source. 
you should also credit all the people in the tc credit list. 
i don't give support and please not ask in this thread.
that's all!

it's the newest wb module system and the most changes are marked with "tocan".
